# Healthbox
An academic group project on a simple Environmental Monitoring &amp; Evaluation System. 

The Hardware is build on an arduino board which is connected to 3 different sensors and to a simple display monitor. Each sensor provides the system with a different environmental reading ( Temperature measurement, Motion detection, Carbon Monoxide & Dioxide Measurement ) The monitor displays those measurements and provides the user with a live feed of the current environmental status. The entirety of the Healthbox physical infrastructure is enclosed within a simple cubic shaped wooden box upon which the sensors and the display monitor are placed at each side, while the arduino board and the connecting cables are hidden away within the box.

The Software is written and developed primarily in C++. 

The fundamental idea resembles a simple IoT application, since the software does not only collect data provided by the sensors but also evaluates the summary and the critical values of those readings to come up with realistic and valuable conclusions and results that can be provided to a server.
